# Contributing to workspace

This repository owns the `workspace` package at the repository root, with its
package-specific examples and metadata. Read the [source guide](docs/API.md).
Keep the compiler identity/version in `manifest.json`, BPM dependencies in
`bpm.json`, API documentation and retained upstream notices consistent.

## Development conventions

Use the installed Buoy language reference and verify changed `.bui` files with
the compiler. Prefer native Buoy/BuoyScript for new automation. Preserve public
command names, environment-variable contracts and explicit platform limitations.

## Build context

Shared build tooling and sibling package sources live in separate repositories.
Use the BuoyBay `workspace-tools` layout with this checkout at `repos/workspace`; assemble
from that workspace root before running builders in `local/integration/`:

```sh
./dist/workspace-manager/buoybay assemble
```

Edit this owning checkout, then reassemble; the generated integration tree is
not the place to keep edits. Do not reassemble while another build is running.

With the native package builder bootstrapped as documented by the workspace's
`devtools` checkout, a source/consumer build can be requested from the workspace:

```sh
./dist/native-package-builder/build-packages --root "$PWD" --compile-consumer workspace
```basic

Use the source guide's specialized builder if native or partial-class staging is
required. The generic driver's import consumer checks linking, not API behavior.

## Verification and pull requests

For each edited Buoy entrypoint, in its documented staged dependency context:

```sh
buoy path/to/entrypoint.bui --check --diagnostic-format json
```

Require exit status zero and an empty `errors` array. Read warnings. Check each
affected conditional platform branch with `--target`; compiler checks do not prove
native runtime behavior on another OS. Build/link and exercise the changed API or
workflow on its supported host as well.

Include compiler/tool versions, host and target, exact build and reproduction
commands, expected behavior and observed output in the pull request. Exercise
changed behavior on its supported host and describe remaining platform limits.
Keep changes focused and omit generated build outputs, caches, credentials and
machine configuration. Inventory checks alone do not establish runtime behavior.
